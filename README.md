# Introduction

Hello, everyone! My name is Jennie. It's my pleasure to stand here again. I'm so excited because I'm closer to my dream. Just like most 12 years old children, we have a dream. Someone wants to become a teacher, someone wants to be a doctor. I want to be a actress. To realize the dream I wanna win the game and play a show on TV. Thank you.
